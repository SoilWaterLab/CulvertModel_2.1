If you run the 00_clipP, this folder will populate with raster files used to estimate P for different return intervals.  The required layers for generating precip values for each watershed is res_1yr - res_500yr (these are the resampled raster files for each return interval).  If you have already created resampled raster files for your region, simply create copies in your Precip folder (Using ArcCatalog), then you will not have to re-run the 00_clipP model for each model run.
